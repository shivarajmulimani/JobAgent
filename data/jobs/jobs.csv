***Tips for writing a stellar job posting***










 Remember it’s an advertisement! Pitch the opportunity and your team. The job posting is a marketing tool and should not be a re\\-hash or cut and paste of the full job description.
 





 Try to achieve a balance between too little and too much detail. Job postings light on detail can increase application volume but could increase the quantity of applicants that are not clear mismatch. Consequently, too much information could turn away job seekers too early in the process and may limit applicant pool.
 





 Include relevant information (job title, specific skills, conditions) and avoid jargon

From catered lunches and office celebrations to employee recognition events (pre and hopefully post\\-Covid) and social professional groups such as the Awesome Women of Netskope (AWON), we strive to keep work fun, supportive and interactive.
