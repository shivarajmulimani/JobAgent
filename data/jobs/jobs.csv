***Tips for writing a stellar job posting***










 Remember it’s an advertisement! Pitch the opportunity and your team. The job posting is a marketing tool and should not be a re\\-hash or cut and paste of the full job description.
 





 Try to achieve a balance between too little and too much detail. Job postings light on detail can increase application volume but could increase the quantity of applicants that are not clear mismatch. Consequently, too much information could turn away job seekers too early in the process and may limit applicant pool.
 





 Include relevant information (job title, specific skills, conditions) and avoid jargon

**\\#WeAreCisco**
 \\#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.
   

  

 We adopt digital and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns, and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!. But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
   

  

 Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break, and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take ambitious steps, and we take the difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
   

  

 So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

Our 10 offices across the United States and India — plus numerous remote employees — all work to modernize the healthcare experience, together.
   

  

**Our Company Culture Might Be Our Best Feature.**
 We don't take ourselves too seriously. But our work? That’s another story. athenahealth develops and implements products and services that support US healthcare: It’s our chance to create healthier futures for ourselves, for our family and friends, for everyone.
   

  

 Our vibrant and talented employees — or athenistas, as we call ourselves — spark the innovation and passion needed to accomplish our goal. We continue to expand our workforce with amazing people who bring diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives at every level, and foster an environment where every athenista feels comfortable bringing their best selves to work.
   

  

 Our size makes a difference, too: We are small enough that your individual contributions will stand out — but large enough to grow your career with our resources and established business stability.
   

  

 Giving back is integral to our culture. Our athenaGives platform strives to support food security, expand access to high\\-quality healthcare for all, and support STEM education to develop providers and technologists who will provide access to high\\-quality healthcare for all in the future.
