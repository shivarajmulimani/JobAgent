Extract, preprocess, and enrich information from various Line of Business (LoB) data sources to support foundational models and AI use cases.  

Collaborate with domain experts across SAP’s business units to align AI and data engineering strategies with business goals.  

Build stable and scalable applications to operationalize AI models and ensure their seamless integration into enterprise systems.  

Guide junior team members and foster a collaborative team environment.  

Lead critical design and implementation decisions, ensuring the alignment of AI and data engineering architectures with SAP’s strategic vision.  

Drive thought leadership in generative AI by leveraging Knowledge Graphs and foundational models for business innovation.

 **What You Bring**

Hands\\-on experience with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure, or BTP).  

Strong knowledge of relational databases, object stores, and vector databases.  

Experience in Knowledge Graph technologies (e.g., RDF, SPARQL) and familiarity with SAP S/4HANA backend data models (e.g., CDS Views, RAP) is a plus.  

Expertise in building scalable data pipelines for AI applications, particularly those involving LLMs or similar models.  

Strong communication, collaboration, and leadership skills, with experience working in agile and cross\\-cultural teams.
