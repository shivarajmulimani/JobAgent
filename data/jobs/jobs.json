        "description":"**Job Description**\n Problem Statement\\-Solution\n   \n\n  \n\n Only 10% of India speaks English and 90% speak over 25 languages and 1000s of dialects. The internet has largely been in English. A good part of India is now getting internet connectivity thanks to cheap smartphones and Jio. The non\\-English speaking internet users will balloon to about 600 million users out of the total 750 million internet users in India by 2020\\. This will make the vernacular segment one of the largest segments in the world \\- almost 2x the size of the US population. The vernacular segment has very few products that they can use on the internet.\n   \n\n  \n\n One large human need is that of sharing thoughts and connecting with people of the same community on the basis of language and common interests. Twitter serves this need globally but the experience is mostly in English. There\u2019s a large unaddressed need for these vernacular users to express themselves in their mother tongue and connect with others from their community. Koo is a solution to this problem.\n   \n\n  \n\n**About Koo**\n Koo was founded in March 2020, as a micro\\-blogging platform in both Indian languages and English, which gives a voice to the millions of Indians who communicate in Indian languages.\n   \n\n  \n\n Currently available in Assamese, Bengali, English, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu, Koo enables people from across India to express themselves online in their mother tongues. In a country where under 10% of the population speaks English as a native language, Koo meets the need for a social media platform that can deliver an immersive language experience to an Indian user, thereby enabling them to connect and interact with each other. The recently introduced \u2018Talk to Type\u2019 enables users to leverage the voice assistant to share their thoughts without having to type. In August 2021, Koo crossed 10 million downloads, in just 16 months of launch.\n   \n\n  \n\n Since June 2021, Koo is available in Nigeria.\n   \n\n  \n\n* Founding Team\n\n\n Koo is founded by veteran internet entrepreneurs \\- Aprameya Radhakrishna (CEO, Taxiforsure) and Mayank Bidawatka (Co\\-founder, Goodbox \\& Coreteam, redBus).\n   \n\n  \n\n Technology Team \\& Culture\n   \n\n  \n\n The technology team comprises sharp coders, technology geeks and guys who have been entrepreneurs or are entrepreneurial and extremely passionate towards technology. Talent is coming from the likes of Google, Walmart, Redbus, Dailyhunt. Anyone being part of a technology team will have a lot to learn from their peers and mentors. Download our android app and take a look at what we\u2019ve built. Technology stack compromises of a wide variety of cutting\\-edge technologies like Kotlin, Java 15, Reactive Programming, MongoDB, Cassandra, Kubernetes, AWS, NodeJS, Python, ReactJS, Redis, Aerospike, ML, Deep learning etc. We believe in giving a lot of independence and autonomy to ownership\\-driven individuals.\n   \n\n  \n\n Technology skill sets required for a matching profile\n   \n\n  \n\n* Experience between 3 to 7 years in a devops role with mandatory one or more stints at a fast paced startup.\n* Mandatory experience with containers, kubernetes (EKS) (setting up from scratch), istio and microservices.\n* Sound knowledge of technologies like Terraform, Automation Scripts, Cron jobs etc. Must have worked with goals of putting infra as code like setting up new environments with code.\n* Knowledge of industry standards around monitoring, alerting, self healing, high availability, auto scaling etc.\n* Exhaustive experience with various cloud technologies (especially on AWS) like SQS, SNS, Elastic Search, Elastic Cache, Elastic Transcoder, VPC, Subnets, Security groups etc.\n* Must have set up stable CI\\-CD pipelines with capabilities to do zero downtime deployments on any one of rolling updates, blue green or canary modes.\n* Experience with VPN and LDAP solutions for securely login to infrastructure and proving SSO. 8\\. Master of deploying and troubleshooting all layers of application from network, frontend, backend and databases (MongoDB, Redis, Postgres, Cassandra, ElasticSearch, Aerospike etc).\n\n\n Skills:\\- DevOps, Kubernetes, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and CI\/CD",

        "description":"**About WeRize**\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n Founded in 2019 by Vishal Chopra and Himanshu Gupta, WeRize is building India\u2019s largest full stack fintechplatform for 500 million underserved middle\\-class customers who live in 5000\\+ small towns of India. WeRize (Wortgage technologies pvt ltd) also owns RBI registered NBFC subsidiary (Wortgage Finance pvt ltd). This customer segmentis not served by privatesector banks, Insurersand Mutual Fund companies due to their low ticket\\-size and lifetime value and is dependent on PSU\/Govt. banks. PSU\/Government banks rarely provide financial products beyond basic savings accounts and these customers lack access to unsecured loans, MSME loans, credit cards, affordable housing loans, loan against property , health and life insurance and investment products.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n WeRize manufactures innovative unsecured consumer credit, mortgages, loan against property, MSME loans,savings and insurance products designed for this customer base keeping in mind their needs, requirements and purchasing power, with a view to add a layer of financial security to their lives and enable access to credit.While customers in these geographies use smartphones, they need properguidance and support when purchasing the right financial products for themselves. So, a pure digital model doesn\u2019t work for this segment. WeRize has innovated on this front through its \u2018Finance ki online dukaan (Social Shopify of Finance)\u2019, a first of its kind social distribution tech platform in the financial services space that educates and enables local financially literate freelancers across these small towns to source business through online and offline channels, recommend the right financial product(s) to customers as well as provide after sales support.These freelancers, who are located in more than 5000\\+ towns and cities, earn as much as INR 30,000 a month from WeRize in commissions.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n Our social distribution platform supported by financially literatefreelancers means exceptionally low cost of customer acquisition (CAC) and operations costs compared to both fully digital and on\\-the\\-ground financial services providers. Digital conversions among this target group are way lower when comparedto upper income customers in metros and hence pure digital CAC doesn\u2019t workfor this segment. While companies like LIC and Fino Bank also rely on freelancer distribution, they deploy local on\\-fieldteams\/branches to manage freelancers in every city. That resultsin very high CAC and operations costs for such companies. WeRize on the other hand, has been able to acquire, train and manage thousandsof freelancers in 5000\\+ citiesonly through its tech platform and without any feet\\-on\\-street team of its own. This results in highly profitable business model for Werize. To know more about the company, please visit: https:\/\/www.werize.com\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**About the role**\n\n\n\n\n You will help solve problems at WeRize across credit\/fraud risk, business, collections, customer service, etc through AI\/ML techniques. As a key member of the team, you work closely with leadership and business\/functional units to manage model lifecycle of build, validate, implement, monitor, and update.\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n**What are we looking for**\n\n\n\n* Demonstrable Modelling experience: In\\-depth understanding of model build and model lifecycle management across supervised and unsupervised learning using structured and unstructured data. (e.g.: Risk Scorecard, Propensity models, Optimization, NLP, etc.)\n* Excellent coding skills: Python coding (a must skill) and developing SQL queries.\n* Strategic \\& Analytical Orientation: Exceptional Logical, Analytical, Reasoning skills complemented by rigor and strong quantitative orientation.\n* Strong communication and stakeholder management skills: Impeccable written and oral communications with ability to manage stakeholder engagement.\n* Strong business judgment and integrity: Should be a tenacious problem solver with good judgment and an open\\-minded approach. One who pushes the envelope but is rooted in ground reality.\n* Self\\-driven: Motivated and comfortable with ambiguity.\n* Team management: Ability to manage and mentor team members.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n Preferred Qualifications \\& Experience\n \n\n\n* Level of experience: 3 to 8 years; prior experience in machine learning is mandatory\n* Graduate or Postgraduate in Engineering, Math, Statistics, Economics, Operations Research\n* Should have demonstrable financial domain specific working knowledge across model lifecycle experience.",
