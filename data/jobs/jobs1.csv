 Problem Statement\\-Solution
   

  

 Only 10% of India speaks English and 90% speak over 25 languages and 1000s of dialects. The internet has largely been in English. A good part of India is now getting internet connectivity thanks to cheap smartphones and Jio. The non\\-English speaking internet users will balloon to about 600 million users out of the total 750 million internet users in India by 2020\\. This will make the vernacular segment one of the largest segments in the world \\- almost 2x the size of the US population. The vernacular segment has very few products that they can use on the internet.
   

  

 One large human need is that of sharing thoughts and connecting with people of the same community on the basis of language and common interests. Twitter serves this need globally but the experience is mostly in English. There’s a large unaddressed need for these vernacular users to express themselves in their mother tongue and connect with others from their community. Koo is a solution to this problem.
   

  

**About Koo**
 Koo was founded in March 2020, as a micro\\-blogging platform in both Indian languages and English, which gives a voice to the millions of Indians who communicate in Indian languages.
   

  

 Currently available in Assamese, Bengali, English, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu, Koo enables people from across India to express themselves online in their mother tongues. In a country where under 10% of the population speaks English as a native language, Koo meets the need for a social media platform that can deliver an immersive language experience to an Indian user, thereby enabling them to connect and interact with each other. The recently introduced ‘Talk to Type’ enables users to leverage the voice assistant to share their thoughts without having to type. In August 2021, Koo crossed 10 million downloads, in just 16 months of launch.
   

  

 Since June 2021, Koo is available in Nigeria.
   

  

* Founding Team


 Koo is founded by veteran internet entrepreneurs \\- Aprameya Radhakrishna (CEO, Taxiforsure) and Mayank Bidawatka (Co\\-founder, Goodbox \\& Coreteam, redBus).
   

  

 Technology Team \\& Culture
   

  

 The technology team comprises sharp coders, technology geeks and guys who have been entrepreneurs or are entrepreneurial and extremely passionate towards technology. Talent is coming from the likes of Google, Walmart, Redbus, Dailyhunt. Anyone being part of a technology team will have a lot to learn from their peers and mentors. Download our android app and take a look at what we’ve built. Technology stack compromises of a wide variety of cutting\\-edge technologies like Kotlin, Java 15, Reactive Programming, MongoDB, Cassandra, Kubernetes, AWS, NodeJS, Python, ReactJS, Redis, Aerospike, ML, Deep learning etc. We believe in giving a lot of independence and autonomy to ownership\\-driven individuals.
   

  

 Technology skill sets required for a matching profile
   

  

* Experience between 3 to 7 years in a devops role with mandatory one or more stints at a fast paced startup.
* Mandatory experience with containers, kubernetes (EKS) (setting up from scratch), istio and microservices.
* Sound knowledge of technologies like Terraform, Automation Scripts, Cron jobs etc. Must have worked with goals of putting infra as code like setting up new environments with code.
* Knowledge of industry standards around monitoring, alerting, self healing, high availability, auto scaling etc.
* Exhaustive experience with various cloud technologies (especially on AWS) like SQS, SNS, Elastic Search, Elastic Cache, Elastic Transcoder, VPC, Subnets, Security groups etc.
* Must have set up stable CI\\-CD pipelines with capabilities to do zero downtime deployments on any one of rolling updates, blue green or canary modes.
* Experience with VPN and LDAP solutions for securely login to infrastructure and proving SSO. 8\\. Master of deploying and troubleshooting all layers of application from network, frontend, backend and databases (MongoDB, Redis, Postgres, Cassandra, ElasticSearch, Aerospike etc).
