        "description":"**Job Description**\n Problem Statement\\-Solution\n   \n\n  \n\n Only 10% of India speaks English and 90% speak over 25 languages and 1000s of dialects. The internet has largely been in English. A good part of India is now getting internet connectivity thanks to cheap smartphones and Jio. The non\\-English speaking internet users will balloon to about 600 million users out of the total 750 million internet users in India by 2020\\. This will make the vernacular segment one of the largest segments in the world \\- almost 2x the size of the US population. The vernacular segment has very few products that they can use on the internet.\n   \n\n  \n\n One large human need is that of sharing thoughts and connecting with people of the same community on the basis of language and common interests. Twitter serves this need globally but the experience is mostly in English. There\u2019s a large unaddressed need for these vernacular users to express themselves in their mother tongue and connect with others from their community. Koo is a solution to this problem.\n   \n\n  \n\n**About Koo**\n Koo was founded in March 2020, as a micro\\-blogging platform in both Indian languages and English, which gives a voice to the millions of Indians who communicate in Indian languages.\n   \n\n  \n\n Currently available in Assamese, Bengali, English, Hindi, Kannada, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu, Koo enables people from across India to express themselves online in their mother tongues. In a country where under 10% of the population speaks English as a native language, Koo meets the need for a social media platform that can deliver an immersive language experience to an Indian user, thereby enabling them to connect and interact with each other. The recently introduced \u2018Talk to Type\u2019 enables users to leverage the voice assistant to share their thoughts without having to type.
