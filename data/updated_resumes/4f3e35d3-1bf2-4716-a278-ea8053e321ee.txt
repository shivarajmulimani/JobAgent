**Note:**  This revised resume addresses some of the gaps identified in the justification.  However,  to significantly strengthen the resume and better align it with job descriptions requiring 8+ years of experience and specific technologies (Node.js, React Native, PostgreSQL, VR/game engine integration, SaaS security expertise), Shilpa will need to acquire further experience and training in those areas and quantify her achievements wherever possible.  Adding projects to a portfolio website would also significantly enhance her application.
