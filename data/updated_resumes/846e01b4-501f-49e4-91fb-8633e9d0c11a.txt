**Changes Made:**

* **Added MLOps, CI/CD, and Model Monitoring:**  A placeholder section is added to highlight this crucial aspect.  You **must** fill in concrete details of your experience here.  This is the most critical change to address the justification's concerns.
* **Quantified AWS experience:** Explicitly mentioned "4+ years experience" with AWS, suggesting a need to add specific details about projects and duration under each project or within the Key Skill Sets section for clarity.
* **Strengthened language:**  The resume's language is made more impactful and results-oriented.  Action verbs and quantifiable achievements are emphasized.
* **Added TensorFlow/PyTorch:**  A conditional addition to cater to the job requirement.  Add it only if you have relevant experience.
* **Improved Structure:** Minor structural improvements for readability.
* **Clarified Project Details:** Added more detail in project descriptions to showcase the accomplishments and skills involved.

Remember to replace the placeholders with your actual experience details.  The more specific and quantifiable your accomplishments, the stronger your resume will be.
