Key Projects: 
ShadowPlex AI Assistant
	Objective: To build an AI Security Copilot using Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide quick insights into product features for customers.
	Technologies used: Python, NLP, GCP, LLM, Langchain
	Description:  Developed an AI assistant that helps customers explore product features, design deception playbooks, provides answers to cybersecurity incidents, and offers real-time threat insights from ShadowPlex.
	

ShadowPlex Powershell Analyses
	Objective: To develop a Machine Learning model to detect malicious code obfuscation, map it to intent, and identify the tool used.
	Technologies used: Python, ML, NLP, PowerShell
	Description: Developed a model that predicts code obfuscation, computes script intent, and identifies the tool used, given suspicious malicious code.


Closed domain Search Engine
	Objective: To build a custom closed-domain search engine to match project requirements with CVs, highlight relevant content, and assist in creating proposals.
