Key Projects: 
ShadowPlex AI Assistant
	Objective
	To build an AI Security Copilot using Large Language models to help customers get quick insights about the product fetures.
	Technologies used
	Python, NLP, GCP, LLM, Langchain
	Description
	* Help Customers explore the product.
* Help Customers in designing the deceptions playbooks.
* Give answers to cyber security related incidents and insights.
* Give real time answers on threat findings by the ShadowPlex.
	

ShadowPlex Powershell Analyses
	Objective
	To build a Machine learning model to detect a malicious code obfuscation and map it to intent and tool.
	Technologies used
	Python, ML, NLP, Powershell
	Description
	* Given suspicious malicious code.
* Predict the code obfuscation.
* Compute the script intent and tool.


	

Closed domain Search Engine
	Objective
	To build a custom closed-domain search engine that matches project requirements with CVs, highlights relevant content, and assists in creating proposals.
	Technologies used
	Python, NLP, AWS, NER, Transformers, Scikit learn
	Description
	* There will be hundreds of thousands of documents, including CVs, proposals, and Terms of Reference (TOR).
* These documents will be processed using NLP techniques such as embeddings, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and topic modeling, and will be trained for domain-specific adaptation.
* Users will be able to find similar documents by entering simple search queries, similar to how one would use Google. The engine will retrieve the most relevant documents and rank them based on user behavior profiles.
	

User entity and behavior analytics 
	Objective
	To develop a User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) system that detects anomalies in user login behavior. The machine learning model will identify irregularities based on factors such as logon time, day of access, historical access patterns, type of logon, and account type.
	Technologies used
	Python, Machine learning, AWS
	Description
	* There will be a data dump containing users' access information from Windows AD logs.
* User data will be segregated, and individual user behavior profiles will be built. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) will be performed to understand the behavior of each user in the network.
* Suitable machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), will be trained. Statistical models will be developed to visualize behavior patterns and detect deviations from typical working behavior.
	

Internet traffic analysis
	Objective
	To develop a system capable of detecting, analyzing, and classifying botnets within web traffic.
	Technologies used
	Python, Interpretable  Machine learning, EDA, Bayesian network, Data mining.
	Description

* Perform behavior analysis, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization.
* Train suitable machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees and DBSCAN, and develop statistical models to visualize behavior patterns and classify web traffic.
	

Anomaly detection in Automobile telematics
	Objective
	To develop a system that detects, analyzes, and classifies anomalies in vehicle sensor readings.
	Technologies used
	Python, Visualization, EDA, Data mining, time series feature extraction.
	Description
	* Collect, clean, and preprocess vehicle sensor readings.
* Perform feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization.
* Train suitable machine learning algorithms, such as Isolation Forest and DBSCAN, and develop statistical models to visualize patterns and classify sensor readings in batch form.
